        <p>I picked up web development since it was in the close category of Computer Science, but picking up on the course, I started to look at webpages in a different perspective.<br>
        I'm personally very fond of websites with unique designs, such as the head page of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/" target="_blank">Roberts Space Industries</a>.<br>
        This is a homepage of a video game about space exploration and space crafts.</p>

        <p>A brief review to the history of web development could be found here</p>

        <h2>Good Links</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">HTML section of W3schools</a>
            W3schools is a pretty good tool for most beginner developers of any languages, it provides basic and advanced syntaxs and examples on how to use them.</li>
            <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stack overflow</a>
            stack overflow is a platform that lets developers post questions and receive answers from other developers in the field. I personally use this if google could not provide a better answer.</li>
            <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github</a>
            Github is a fantastic tool for developers to share their projects and inquiry specific questions, I use this to host all my work for my CNIT courses so far.</li>
