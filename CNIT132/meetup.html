            <h2>How to design a user friendly webpage for people with disability or special needs</h2>

            <article>
                <p>Most webpages and contents were made without considering the need of people with disability, such as loss of hearing or loss of sight</p>
                <p>Softwares such as text to speechs or captions help those people consume these contents, but the design of the website ultimately have to take more consideration</p>
                <p>Text to speech softwares were used for people with sight problems or disablity, it reads out everything on a page, this includes emojis and alt text of a image element</p>
                <p>An exmaple follows below</p>
                <img src="tts bad username.png" alt="A sample image of a twitter username followed by a string of emojis">
                <audio controls>
                    <source src="tts bad sample.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                </audio>

                <p>the tts description does not match the intention of the emoji in this case, and this could lead to misunderstanding for people who are using tts software</p>

                <p>it is also best in mind to include a brief and decise alt text to a image that you will use.</p>

                <p>often times web designers also uses images as a link in the building of the menu, if you were to build a menu using images, you should treat them as links first, consider their location and the purpose of it,<br>
                    is it a portal link, is there other imporant elements on the page?</p>
                
                <p>It is best to keep in mind that text to speech softwares would also read out a full link if it captures it.</p>

                <p>The usage of headers should also be considered, it is best to avoid redundancy between headers and titles, or placing headers out of order for visuals, as it could confuse the text to speech softwares.</p>

                <p>It is also worth taking caution when using animated gifs that loops, designers should avoid overly flashy or dramatic effects, 
                    as it could cause seizures, migraines, vertigo or being a distraction in general. <br>(It is worth mentioning that roughly 35% of Americans who are 40 or above develops motion sickness)</p>

                <p>Centralized content like this adds friction to the reading experience, keeping it simple is the best action to take for making pages for the disabled</p>

                <p>For content such as the audio player above or videos, skipping autoplay would be better for the user experience, letting go of sliders and slideshows and add more player controls, more controls over contents provides a better user experience</p>

                <p>It is not a simple process to create user friendly content, it is best to keep making these and recieve feedbacks from screen reader, contrast reader test cases and actual user feedbacks</p>
